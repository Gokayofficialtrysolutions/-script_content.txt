# Terminus AI - Roadmap Towards an Ultimate AGI Orchestrator

This document outlines a high-level, multi-phase vision for the continued development of Terminus AI, aiming towards the goal of creating an increasingly intelligent, capable, and autonomous "Ultimate AGI Orchestrator." Each phase represents a significant leap in capabilities.

## Guiding Principles
*   **Local First, Cloud Optional:** Prioritize functionalities that can run on user hardware, with optional integration for cloud resources where beneficial.
*   **Open & Transparent:** Continue development with open-source principles, ensuring clarity in architecture and operation.
*   **User-Centric & Intuitive:** Strive for interactions that feel natural and require minimal effort for complex tasks ("works like a mind").
*   **Professional Quality Output:** Ensure that generated content (code, images, text, etc.) and system operations are of high quality and reliability.
*   **Modular & Extensible:** Design components that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Phase X: Advanced Cognitive Orchestration (Building on Current MasterPlanner)
*   **Enhanced `MasterPlanner` Capabilities:**
    *   **Complex Plan Structures:** Support for parallel execution of independent plan steps, conditional logic (if-then-else based on step outputs), and basic looping/retry mechanisms within plans.
    *   **Dynamic Plan Adaptation:** Allow `MasterPlanner` to modify plans mid-execution based on intermediate results or errors, going beyond single-cycle revision.
    *   **Resource-Aware Planning:** Enable `MasterPlanner` to consider (simulated or actual) agent load or resource constraints.
*   **Sophisticated Intent Understanding:**
    *   Move beyond basic classification to more nuanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) of user intents, including disambiguation and implicit goal extraction.
    *   Potentially integrate a dedicated NLU module or agent.

## Phase Y: Learning & Long-Term Memory
*   **Persistent Knowledge Base:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for Terminus AI to store and retrieve key information, user preferences, successful plans, and learned facts across sessions (e.g., using a local vector database or graph database).
*   **User Feedback Loop & Reinforcement Learning (Basic):**
    *   Allow users to rate the quality/success of agent actions or completed plans.
    *   Implement simple reinforcement learning mechanisms where this feedback can (over time) influence agent selection, prompt strategies, or plan generation for common tasks.
*   **Learning from Documents & Web:**
    *   Enable agents to ingest and learn from user-provided documents or specified web resources to build up a knowledge base for specific domains or tasks.

## Phase Z: Expanded Autonomous Capabilities & Proactivity
*   **Advanced Tool Use by Agents:**
    *   Develop a framework where agents can discover and utilize other agents or tools dynamically and autonomously to achieve complex goals (e.g., `ResearchBot` using `WebCrawler` then `DataWizard` then `CreativeWriter`).
*   **Proactive Assistance (Experimental):**
    *   Explore capabilities for Terminus AI to suggest next steps, offer optimizations, or anticipate user needs based on context and learned patterns.
*   **Expanded Multimedia & Creative Suite:**
    *   Integrate more advanced video editing/generation models.
    *   Add music generation and synthesis capabilities.
    *   Tools for 3D asset generation or manipulation.
*   **Self-Improvement Concepts (Research Focus):**
    *   Conceptual exploration of how the system might identify areas for its own improvement (e.g., outdated dependencies â€“ though auto-updating is risky, or frequently failing plan types).

## Foundational Research & Development ("Neural Connections" & True AGI)
*   This area represents the long-term, ambitious goal of achieving AGI-like "neural connections" and general problem-solving capabilities that may require breakthroughs beyond current software engineering practices.
*   Focus on staying updated with academic research in AGI, cognitive architectures, and advanced AI, and incrementally integrating proven concepts where feasible and safe.
*   Explore neuro-symbolic approaches that combine the strengths of LLMs with structured reasoning and knowledge representation.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Ongoing)
*   **Security & Sandboxing:** Continuously improve security, especially as agents gain more autonomy or ability to execute system commands.
*   **Ethical Alignment & Safety:** As capabilities grow, ensure mechanisms for safe operation and alignment with user intent and ethical guidelines.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Ongoing efforts to optimize all components for speed and resource efficiency.
*   **Dependency Management:** Continue to ensure all dependencies are pinned and updated responsibly.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Implement more comprehensive automated testing, including integration tests for complex agent interactions and planned workflows.

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as the project progresses and new research & technologies become available.
