## Section 2: "Roadmap: Towards an Ultimate AGI Orchestrator"

**Overall AGI Orchestrator Progress:** ~22-27% (V1 foundations, V1.x enhancements in MasterPlanner orchestration, Knowledge Base, Inter-Agent Message Bus, and initial User Feedback Mechanisms contribute to this).

### Phase X: Advanced Cognitive Orchestration
*Key Objectives:*

    *   [ ] Resource-Aware & Prioritized Planning
*   [X] **Sophisticated Intent Understanding & Contextual Awareness:** (Initial NLU enhancements implemented)
    *   [X] Nuanced NLU (ambiguity, implicit goals, long-term context) - *Enhanced with NER for entity extraction; MasterPlanner KB pre-query leverages this for better contextual awareness.*
    *   [ ] Dedicated NLU module/agent
    *   [ ] Richer contextual model of interaction & user objectives

### Phase Y: System Learning, Memory & Adaptation
*Key Objectives:*

*   [X] **Knowledge Ingestion & Synthesis:** (Basic agent-driven ingestion implemented)
    *   [X] Autonomous ingestion from documents/links - *WebCrawler and DocumentProcessor (via UI) now store processed content/summaries in KB. CodeMaster stores explanations/generations.*
    *   [ ] Summarization & indexing of ingested data - *Basic summarization before storage for WebCrawler; indexing is inherent to ChromaDB.*

### Phase Z: Expanded Autonomy & Collaborative Intelligence
