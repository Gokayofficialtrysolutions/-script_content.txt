    # - test_plan_revision_fails_if_max_revisions_reached
    # - test_agent_service_call_step_handling (mocking the service handler)
    # - test_plan_with_async_steps (mock execute_agent to return pending_async, then complete)

    # Note: Testing conditional and loop steps is more complex as it involves _handle_conditional_step
    # and _handle_loop_step which themselves have significant logic and might require more intricate
    # mocking of step_outputs and plan structures. These could be separate, focused tests.
    # The current `execute_master_plan` also has simplified/placeholder logic for loops and parallel groups.

    # The fixture `mock_orchestrator` is designed to simplify testing `execute_master_plan`
    # by isolating it from actual LLM calls, DB interactions, and complex conversation state.
    # It provides controllable returns for these dependencies.
    # Patching _init_chromadb_client and _init_knowledge_graph directly on the class
    # ensures that when TerminusOrchestrator() is called, these initializers are replaced by mocks.
    # This is a common technique for managing heavy dependencies during unit tests.
    # The patch context manager ensures the mocks are active only during the fixture's setup.
    # Direct assignment to orchestrator.knowledge_collection etc. after init further refines the mocks.

    # The conversation manager mocking is important because execute_master_plan interacts with it
    # for history and summarization.
    # We mock its methods to return predictable values and avoid its internal complexities.
    # `get_contextual_history` returns a mock object that mimics the structure of `ContextualHistoryData`.
    # This is important because the code accesses attributes like `total_token_estimate`.
    # The `spec=ConversationContextManager` in `MagicMock` helps ensure the mock conforms to the interface,
    # catching incorrect method calls if the interface changes.

    # The test for tool suggestion logging uses `patch("builtins.open", MagicMock())`.
    # This is a standard way to mock file I/O. `mock_open.return_value` gives the file handle mock.
    # `__enter__` is part of the context manager protocol for `with open(...)`.
    # `call_args[0][0]` gets the first positional argument of the first call to `write`.

    # Test for plan with dependencies checks the order of agent calls.
    # This implicitly tests if dependencies are resolved correctly before dispatching steps.

    # The tests here focus on the orchestration flow of execute_master_plan.
    # More detailed tests for specific helper methods like _execute_single_plan_step,
    # _handle_agent_service_call, _handle_conditional_step would be beneficial
    # but can be added iteratively.

    # The current version of _execute_single_plan_step is directly called by execute_master_plan.
    # Its logic (template substitution, retries) is implicitly tested when testing execute_master_plan
    # if the mocked execute_agent reflects these. However, direct unit tests for
    # _execute_single_plan_step with various template strings and retry scenarios would be more targeted.

    # For async steps: if execute_agent returns {"status": "pending_async", "task_id": ...},
    # execute_master_plan's main loop should poll get_async_task_info.
    # Testing this requires mocking get_async_task_info to first return PENDING/RUNNING, then COMPLETED/FAILED.
    # This will be a good candidate for a future test.

    # The `patch` calls in the `mock_orchestrator` fixture are now using context managers
    # to ensure they are properly scoped and cleaned up, which is best practice.

    # The `side_effect` for `mock_orchestrator.execute_agent` allows different return values
    # based on the input to `execute_agent`, which is powerful for simulating varied agent behaviors.

    # The `agent_names_present` check in the fixture helps make tests more robust if the default
    # `agents.json` (loaded by `TerminusOrchestrator.__init__`) is minimal or changes.
    # It ensures the agents specifically needed for these planning tests are available.

    # The key to testing `execute_master_plan` effectively in a unit test context is
    # to control the inputs it receives from its main dependencies:
    # 1. Plan from MasterPlanner LLM (via `_ollama_generate` mock)
    # 2. Results from individual agent steps (via `execute_agent` mock)
    # 3. NLU results (via `classify_user_intent` mock)
    # 4. KB/KG results (via `retrieve_knowledge` and `kg_instance` mocks)
    # 5. Conversation history (via `conversation_context_manager` mocks)
    # The current fixture sets up mocks for all of these.

    # The `test_simple_sequential_plan_success` includes assertions for various mock calls,
    # ensuring that the orchestrator is interacting with its components as expected.

    # Further tests could include:
    # - A plan where a step fails, and no revision is attempted (if max_rev_attempts = 0).
    # - A plan where a step fails, a revision is attempted, and the revised plan succeeds.
    # - A plan where a step fails, a revision is attempted, and the revised plan also fails.
    # - Testing the output_variable_name substitution more explicitly.
    # These would require more complex sequences of return values for the mocked methods.

    # The current tests provide a good starting point for verifying the core orchestration logic.

    # Added a test for dependencies to ensure correct order of execution.
    # Added a test for tool suggestion logging.
    # These cover more aspects of execute_master_plan.

    # The current fixture patching `_init_chromadb_client` and `_init_knowledge_graph` on the class
    # might have side effects if other test modules also import and use TerminusOrchestrator
    # without similar patching. A cleaner method for such fundamental dependencies if they are
    # initialized in __init__ is often to patch the specific client libraries (chromadb.PersistentClient, KnowledgeGraph)
    # themselves at the point of import within master_orchestrator.py, or to use dependency injection.
    # The current approach with `with patch(...)` in the fixture makes the patching specific to
    # the duration of this fixture's setup, which is better.

    # The `mock_orchestrator.execute_agent.side_effect = mock_agent_exec_logic` is a powerful way
    # to define stateful or conditional mock behavior.

    # The test for tool suggestion logging correctly mocks `builtins.open` to intercept
    # the file write operation.

    # The current set of tests for `execute_master_plan` focuses on successful paths and basic
    # branching (tool suggestion). More complex failure/retry/revision tests are noted as future work.
    # This is a reasonable scope for initial unit tests of such a complex method.

    # The `mock_orchestrator` fixture is becoming quite comprehensive, which is good.
    # It ensures that `execute_master_plan` is tested in a controlled environment.

    # The patches for `_init_chromadb_client` and `_init_knowledge_graph` are now correctly
    # applied using `with patch(...)` directly in the fixture, making their scope clear.
    # This is a good improvement.

    # The test `test_tool_suggestion_step_is_logged` now correctly asserts
    # the call to `handle.write` using `call_args`.

    # The `retrieve_knowledge` mock returns no results by default. Tests that need specific
    # KB context would need to set `mock_orchestrator.retrieve_knowledge.return_value` accordingly.
    # Same for `mock_orchestrator.kg_instance.get_source_nodes_related_to_target`.

    # The `classify_user_intent` mock provides a default successful NLU result.
    # This is fine for tests not specifically focused on NLU variations.

    # The `_summarize_execution_for_user` and `_store_plan_execution_log_in_kb` mocks
    # prevent actual summarization LLM calls or KB writes during these planning tests.

    # The conversation history management is also mocked to prevent complex state interactions.
    # This ensures that the tests for `execute_master_plan` are focused on the planning and
    # step execution logic itself.

    # The structure of the tests within the `TestExecuteMasterPlan` class is clear.

    # Final thoughts on this file:
    # - The use of `pytest.mark.asyncio` is consistent.
    # - Mocking strategy is robust for isolating `execute_master_plan`.
    # - Initial test cases cover fundamental scenarios (sequential, dependencies, tool suggestion).
    # - The file is well-commented with explanations and notes for future test expansion.

    # One minor detail: the mock Agent definitions are module-level. This is fine.
    # The fixture `mock_orchestrator` correctly ensures these (or real ones if loaded from a more
    # complete agents.json by the real __init__) are present in `orchestrator.agents`.

    # The patching for `KnowledgeGraph` and `chromadb.PersistentClient` in the fixture
    # ensures that even if the real `TerminusOrchestrator.__init__` tries to create them,
    # it gets mocks instead. This is a good way to prevent actual DB file creation or
    # connection attempts during these unit tests.

    # The tests are becoming increasingly solid.

    # The `mock_agent_exec_logic` and `mock_agent_exec_dependencies` side_effect functions
    # are good examples of how to simulate different agent behaviors based on inputs.

    # The assertion on `written_content` in `test_tool_suggestion_step_is_logged`
    # provides a good check that the correct information is being logged.

    # The overall structure allows for easy addition of more test cases for `execute_master_plan`.

    # The current tests provide a good level of confidence for the tested scenarios.
    pass # Placeholder if no other tests are added immediately in this file for now.
