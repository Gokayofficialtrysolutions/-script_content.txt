# Terminalis AGI - Development Log & Process Summary (Z Report)

This document summarizes the major phases, key features implemented, and significant decisions made during the development and enhancement of the Terminalis AGI ecosystem.

## Phase 0: Initial Codebase Analysis & Weakness Identification
*   **Objective:** Understand the initial `script_content.txt` and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Key Findings:** Monolithic bash script, lack of version pinning for Python dependencies, basic error handling, hardcoded configurations, opportunities for new features.

## Phase 1: Initial Improvements & Professional Automation Foundations
*   **Objective:** Refactor the core script, standardize dependencies, improve robustness, and externalize configurations.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   Refactored `script_content.txt` into logical Bash functions.
    *   Python dependencies shifted to `*_requirements.txt` files with (initial) version pinning.
    *   Enhanced error handling in the installer (`set -e`, improved messages, exit on critical failures).
    *   Addressed security concern in `auto_dev.py`'s `run_command` method (using `shlex.split`).
    *   Externalized AI agent configurations into `agents.json`.
    *   Improved `launch_terminus.py` with better process monitoring (restart limits).
    *   Added initial user experience improvements to installer (disk space check, Ollama pre-check).
    *   Created initial `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE`.

## Phase 1.5: Finalize Phase 1 Professional Automation (Interim Plan)
*   **Objective:** Complete remaining UI and orchestration logic from initial goals.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   Added Streamlit Dashboard project template to `auto_dev.py`.
    *   Updated UI (`terminus_ui.py`) for new project scaffolding options.
    *   Implemented foundational "Intelligent Task Orchestration" in `master_orchestrator.py` (basic keyword routing).

## Phase 2: Basic Video Agent & Code Mod Backend/UI (Scope adjusted by subtask reporting)
*   **Objective:** Introduce multimedia capabilities (video) and initial AI code modification.

        *   Backend methods for audio info, format conversion, TTS in orchestrator.
        *   New "Audio Processing" UI section.
    *   **Enhanced Orchestrator Intent (Contextual Awareness):**
        *   `parallel_execution` in orchestrator now uses UI `operation_mode` as a primary hint for agent selection.

## Phase 4: Advanced Orchestration & Specialized AI Integration
*   **Objective:** Introduce a planning agent and more advanced intent understanding.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Agent:**
        *   Defined `MasterPlanner` agent in `agents.json` (using a powerful LLM).
        *   Implemented `execute_master_plan` in orchestrator: prompts `MasterPlanner` for a JSON plan, parses it, and executes steps sequentially with basic dependency substitution.
        *   UI toggle in "Multi-Agent Chat" to enable `MasterPlanner`.
        *   UI logic to display multi-step plan results.
    *   **Advanced Intent Classifier:**
        *   Integrated zero-shot classification (`transformers` pipeline with `facebook/bart-large-mnli`) into `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Classified intent is passed as context to `MasterPlanner`.

## Phase 5: Dependency Finalization & Enhanced Planner/Context
*   **Objective:** Resolve most pending dependencies and further improve MasterPlanner's context.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Aggressive Dependency Resolution:** Successfully updated versions for most remaining placeholder dependencies (tensorflow-quantum, cirq, distributed, pyarrow, etc.). `passlib` remains unresolved.
    *   **Enhanced MasterPlanner (Dynamic Agent Awareness):** `MasterPlanner` prompt now uses a dynamically generated list of available agent capabilities.
    *   **Contextual Memory:** Implemented conversation history in `TerminusOrchestrator`; history is passed to `MasterPlanner` and assistant turns are summarized by an LLM for the history.
    *   **UI for Conversation History:** Added UI expander to show recent conversation history.

## Phase 6: SystemAdmin Enhancements & Verification (Current work before this log)
*   **Objective:** Add more system diagnostic tools and verify previous complex implementations.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **SystemAdmin Backend:** Added `get_os_info`, `get_cpu_info`, `get_network_config` to orchestrator, with platform-aware commands. Updated `execute_agent` routing for `SystemAdmin`. (Verified via manual file read after subtask).
    *   **SystemAdmin UI:** Added UI elements in "System Information" to trigger and display results from new diagnostic capabilities. (Verified via subtask report).
    *   **MasterPlanner Iterative Refinement Verification:** Confirmed backend logic for one-cycle plan revision is present. (Verified via subtask report).

## Phase 7: V1 Perfection, MasterPlanner Retry Logic & Initial KB Schema
*   **Objective:** Refine V1 by verifying dependencies, ensuring feature completeness at code level, and enhancing MasterPlanner with step-level retry capabilities. Define initial schema for Knowledge Base interactions.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Dependency Audit:** Verified all `*_requirements.txt` files; confirmed `passlib==1.7.4` and absence of placeholder versions. Noted that `README.md`'s concern about placeholders was outdated.
    *   **V1 Feature Code Review:** Systematically reviewed code for all V1 features listed in `PROJECT_TRACKING.md` against `master_orchestrator.py` and `terminus_ui.py` (extracted from `script_content.txt`). Confirmed presence and apparent completeness.
    *   **MasterPlanner Step Retry Enhancement:**
        *   Modified `execute_master_plan` in `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Added JSON plan validation for required keys (`step_id`, `agent_name`, `task_prompt`) and types for each step before execution. This was the "MasterPlanner Enhancement (Roadmap Alignment & Perfection)" from prior plan.
        *   (Actual step-level retry logic was implemented in Phase 9, this phase focused on plan validation as an initial enhancement to MasterPlanner robustness).
    *   **Installer Script `TOTAL` Variable Verification:** Confirmed accuracy of `TOTAL=18` in `script_content.txt`.
    *   **Knowledge Base Retry Schema (Planning):** Defined schema for retry parameters (`max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`, `retry_on_statuses`) to be included in individual plan steps for the *next* MasterPlanner enhancement.
    *   **MasterPlanner Prompt Update (for Step Retries):** Updated MasterPlanner LLM prompt to inform it about the new optional retry parameters it could include in generated plans.

## Phase 8: Knowledge Base Implementation (Backend & UI Explorer)
*   **Objective:** Implement the foundational persistent knowledge base using ChromaDB and provide a UI for user interaction.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **ChromaDB Setup:**
        *   Integrated `chromadb` into `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Initialized `PersistentClient` storing data at `$INSTALL_DIR/data/vector_store`.
        *   Used default `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction`.
        *   Created/loaded collection "terminus_knowledge_v1".
    *   **`store_knowledge` Method:** Implemented in `TerminusOrchestrator` to add text content with metadata to ChromaDB, including ID generation and metadata cleaning.
    *   **`retrieve_knowledge` Method:** Implemented in `TerminusOrchestrator` for semantic search with `n_results` and basic metadata filtering.
    *   **KB Integration (Document Processing):** Modified `terminus_ui.py` so that document excerpts are stored in the KB when "Analyze with AI" is used.
    *   **UI for KB Explorer:** Added "Knowledge Base Explorer" mode to `terminus_ui.py` with UI elements for querying the KB (text input, n_results, optional key-value metadata filter) and displaying results (ID, distance, content, metadata).

## Phase 9: MasterPlanner Orchestration Enhancements - Step Retries & Parallel Execution
*   **Objective:** Implement step-level retry logic and basic parallel execution capabilities for the MasterPlanner.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Step-Level Retry Logic:**
        *   Implemented the previously defined retry logic in `execute_master_plan`. Individual steps now use their `max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`, `retry_on_statuses` parameters.
    *   **Parallel Execution Capability:**
        *   Defined plan schema for `agent_name: "parallel_group"` containing `sub_steps`.
        *   Updated MasterPlanner LLM prompt to explain how to define parallel groups and their constraints (input-independence of sub-steps).
        *   Refactored single step execution into `_execute_single_plan_step` helper method.
        *   Implemented logic in `execute_master_plan` to identify `parallel_group` steps, execute their `sub_steps` concurrently via `asyncio.gather` (each sub-step using `_execute_single_plan_step`), aggregate results, and handle group-level success/failure and retries.

## Phase 10: MasterPlanner Targeted Revision Context Enhancement
*   **Objective:** Improve the MasterPlanner's plan revision capability by providing more detailed failure context.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Detailed Failure Context Capture:** Modified `execute_master_plan` to capture:
        *   The definition of the failed step/group.
        *   The execution result (error) of that failed step/group.
        *   `step_outputs` from prior successful steps in the current attempt.
        *   The JSON string of the plan that was being executed when the failure occurred.
    *   **Enhanced Revision Prompt:** Updated the revision prompt for the MasterPlanner LLM to include this detailed failure context, explicitly guiding it to analyze the specifics and make minimal, targeted changes to the plan.

## Phase 11: Knowledge Base Augmentation by WebCrawler & CodeMaster Agents
*   **Objective:** Enable WebCrawler and CodeMaster agents to proactively store their valuable outputs in the Knowledge Base.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **`WebIntelligence.scrape_page` Modified:**
        *   Returns full text and a structured dictionary output (status, content, URL, message).
        *   Improved error handling and basic HTML content cleaning.
    *   **`execute_agent` for `WebCrawler` Enhanced:**
        *   When scraping a URL, it now attempts to summarize the scraped content (using `DocProcessor`).
        *   Stores the summary (or an excerpt if summarization fails) into the KB with metadata (source, URL, timestamp). Storage is asynchronous (`asyncio.create_task`).
    *   **`explain_code_snippet` Enhanced:** After successful explanation, stores the snippet and explanation in KB with metadata.
    *   **`generate_code_module` Enhanced:** After successful code generation, stores requirements and generated code in KB with metadata.

## Ongoing Challenges & Notes
*   **Dependency Version Lookup:** (Resolved) The concern about placeholder dependencies in `README.md` has been addressed; all dependencies in `*_requirements.txt` are now pinned. The `passlib` specific issue was also resolved to `passlib==1.7.4`.
*   **Subtask Reporting Inconsistencies:** (Historical Note) Throughout development, there were several instances where subtask execution reports did not align with the requested task, requiring manual verification or re-runs. This complicated progress tracking. (This note remains for historical context of the overall project development if it refers to agent's interaction with a human, not specific to this session's automated tasks).

This log serves as a high-level summary of the development journey and the current state of the project.
