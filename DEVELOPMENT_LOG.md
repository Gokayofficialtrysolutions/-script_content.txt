## Phase 4: Advanced Orchestration & Specialized AI Integration
*   **Objective:** Introduce a planning agent and more advanced intent understanding.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Agent:**
        *   Defined `MasterPlanner` agent in `agents.json` (using a powerful LLM).
        *   Implemented `execute_master_plan` in orchestrator: prompts `MasterPlanner` for a JSON plan, parses it, and executes steps sequentially with basic dependency substitution.
        *   UI toggle in "Multi-Agent Chat" to enable `MasterPlanner`.
        *   UI logic to display multi-step plan results.
    *   **Advanced Intent Classifier:**
        *   Integrated zero-shot classification (`transformers` pipeline with `facebook/bart-large-mnli`) into `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Classified intent is passed as context to `MasterPlanner`.

## Phase 5: Dependency Finalization & Enhanced Planner/Context
*   **Objective:** Resolve most pending dependencies and further improve MasterPlanner's context.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Aggressive Dependency Resolution:** Successfully updated versions for most remaining placeholder dependencies (tensorflow-quantum, cirq, distributed, pyarrow, etc.). `passlib` remains unresolved.
    *   **Enhanced MasterPlanner (Dynamic Agent Awareness):** `MasterPlanner` prompt now uses a dynamically generated list of available agent capabilities.
    *   **Contextual Memory:** Implemented conversation history in `TerminusOrchestrator`; history is passed to `MasterPlanner` and assistant turns are summarized by an LLM for the history.
    *   **UI for Conversation History:** Added UI expander to show recent conversation history.

## Phase 6: SystemAdmin Enhancements & Verification (Current work before this log)
*   **Objective:** Add more system diagnostic tools and verify previous complex implementations.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **SystemAdmin Backend:** Added `get_os_info`, `get_cpu_info`, `get_network_config` to orchestrator, with platform-aware commands. Updated `execute_agent` routing for `SystemAdmin`. (Verified via manual file read after subtask).
    *   **SystemAdmin UI:** Added UI elements in "System Information" to trigger and display results from new diagnostic capabilities. (Verified via subtask report).
    *   **MasterPlanner Iterative Refinement Verification:** Confirmed backend logic for one-cycle plan revision is present. (Verified via subtask report).

## Phase 7: V1 Perfection, MasterPlanner Retry Logic & Initial KB Schema
*   **Objective:** Refine V1 by verifying dependencies, ensuring feature completeness at code level, and enhancing MasterPlanner with step-level retry capabilities. Define initial schema for Knowledge Base interactions.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Dependency Audit:** Verified all `*_requirements.txt` files; confirmed `passlib==1.7.4` and absence of placeholder versions. Noted that `README.md`'s concern about placeholders was outdated.
    *   **V1 Feature Code Review:** Systematically reviewed code for all V1 features listed in `PROJECT_TRACKING.md` against `master_orchestrator.py` and `terminus_ui.py` (extracted from `script_content.txt`). Confirmed presence and apparent completeness.
    *   **MasterPlanner Step Retry Enhancement:**
        *   Modified `execute_master_plan` in `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Added JSON plan validation for required keys (`step_id`, `agent_name`, `task_prompt`) and types for each step before execution. This was the "MasterPlanner Enhancement (Roadmap Alignment & Perfection)" from prior plan.
        *   (Actual step-level retry logic was implemented in Phase 9, this phase focused on plan validation as an initial enhancement to MasterPlanner robustness).
    *   **Installer Script `TOTAL` Variable Verification:** Confirmed accuracy of `TOTAL=18` in `script_content.txt`.
    *   **Knowledge Base Retry Schema (Planning):** Defined schema for retry parameters (`max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`, `retry_on_statuses`) to be included in individual plan steps for the *next* MasterPlanner enhancement.
    *   **MasterPlanner Prompt Update (for Step Retries):** Updated MasterPlanner LLM prompt to inform it about the new optional retry parameters it could include in generated plans.

## Phase 8: Knowledge Base Implementation (Backend & UI Explorer)
*   **Objective:** Implement the foundational persistent knowledge base using ChromaDB and provide a UI for user interaction.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **ChromaDB Setup:**
        *   Integrated `chromadb` into `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Initialized `PersistentClient` storing data at `$INSTALL_DIR/data/vector_store`.
        *   Used default `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction`.
        *   Created/loaded collection "terminus_knowledge_v1".
    *   **`store_knowledge` Method:** Implemented in `TerminusOrchestrator` to add text content with metadata to ChromaDB, including ID generation and metadata cleaning.
    *   **`retrieve_knowledge` Method:** Implemented in `TerminusOrchestrator` for semantic search with `n_results` and basic metadata filtering.
    *   **KB Integration (Document Processing):** Modified `terminus_ui.py` so that document excerpts are stored in the KB when "Analyze with AI" is used.
    *   **UI for KB Explorer:** Added "Knowledge Base Explorer" mode to `terminus_ui.py` with UI elements for querying the KB (text input, n_results, optional key-value metadata filter) and displaying results (ID, distance, content, metadata).

## Phase 9: MasterPlanner Orchestration Enhancements - Step Retries & Parallel Execution
*   **Objective:** Implement step-level retry logic and basic parallel execution capabilities for the MasterPlanner.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Step-Level Retry Logic:**
        *   Implemented the previously defined retry logic in `execute_master_plan`. Individual steps now use their `max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`, `retry_on_statuses` parameters.
    *   **Parallel Execution Capability:**
        *   Defined plan schema for `agent_name: "parallel_group"` containing `sub_steps`.
        *   Updated MasterPlanner LLM prompt to explain how to define parallel groups and their constraints (input-independence of sub-steps).
        *   Refactored single step execution into `_execute_single_plan_step` helper method.
        *   Implemented logic in `execute_master_plan` to identify `parallel_group` steps, execute their `sub_steps` concurrently via `asyncio.gather` (each sub-step using `_execute_single_plan_step`), aggregate results, and handle group-level success/failure and retries.

## Phase 10: MasterPlanner Targeted Revision Context Enhancement
*   **Objective:** Improve the MasterPlanner's plan revision capability by providing more detailed failure context.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Detailed Failure Context Capture:** Modified `execute_master_plan` to capture:
        *   The definition of the failed step/group.
        *   The execution result (error) of that failed step/group.
        *   `step_outputs` from prior successful steps in the current attempt.
        *   The JSON string of the plan that was being executed when the failure occurred.
    *   **Enhanced Revision Prompt:** Updated the revision prompt for the MasterPlanner LLM to include this detailed failure context, explicitly guiding it to analyze the specifics and make minimal, targeted changes to the plan.

## Phase 11: Knowledge Base Augmentation by WebCrawler & CodeMaster Agents
*   **Objective:** Enable WebCrawler and CodeMaster agents to proactively store their valuable outputs in the Knowledge Base.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **`WebIntelligence.scrape_page` Modified:**
        *   Returns full text and a structured dictionary output (status, content, URL, message).
        *   Improved error handling and basic HTML content cleaning.
    *   **`execute_agent` for `WebCrawler` Enhanced:**
        *   When scraping a URL, it now attempts to summarize the scraped content (using `DocProcessor`).
        *   Stores the summary (or an excerpt if summarization fails) into the KB with metadata (source, URL, timestamp). Storage is asynchronous (`asyncio.create_task`).
    *   **`explain_code_snippet` Enhanced:** After successful explanation, stores the snippet and explanation in KB with metadata.
    *   **`generate_code_module` Enhanced:** After successful code generation, stores requirements and generated code in KB with metadata.

## Phase 12: Inter-Agent Message Bus & Reactive KB Content Analysis
*   **Objective:** Implement a basic message bus for inter-agent communication and use it to trigger reactive analysis of new KB content.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Message Bus Implementation (`TerminusOrchestrator`):**
        *   Added `self.message_bus_subscribers` (dictionary for message type to handler list).
        *   Implemented `publish_message` (creates message, dispatches to async handlers or queues).
        *   Implemented `subscribe_to_message` (registers handlers).
    *   **Event Publishing:** Key methods like `store_knowledge` (after successful KB write by WebCrawler, CodeMaster, DocProcessor) and `execute_master_plan` (for plan logs) now publish events (e.g., `"kb.webcontent.added"`, `"kb.plan_log.added"`).
    *   **`ContentAnalysisAgent` & Keyword Extraction:**
        *   Defined `ContentAnalysisAgent` in `agents.json`.
        *   Implemented `_handle_new_kb_content_for_analysis` subscriber in `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   This handler receives `kb.*.added` messages, retrieves the KB item.
        *   Calls an LLM (`ContentAnalysisAgent`) to extract keywords from the content.
        *   Uses `_update_kb_item_metadata` to add `extracted_keywords` to the KB item.

## Phase 13: MasterPlanner Semantic Enhancement & User Feedback System
*   **Objective:** Enhance MasterPlanner's contextual understanding using KB keywords and implement a comprehensive user feedback system.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Keyword Utilization:**
        *   Modified `execute_master_plan` to include `extracted_keywords` (if present in retrieved KB items' metadata) in the context provided to the main planning LLM.
        *   Updated MasterPlanner prompt to instruct it to leverage these keywords.
        *   Refined KB query for plan logs to include NLU entities from the user request.
    *   **User Feedback Mechanism:**
        *   Defined feedback data structure (`feedback_id`, `item_id`, `item_type`, `rating`, `comment`, etc.).
        *   Implemented `TerminusOrchestrator.store_user_feedback` to log feedback to `$LOG_DIR/feedback_log.jsonl` and publish a `"user.feedback.submitted"` message.
        *   **UI Integration (`terminus_ui.py`):** Added feedback widgets (👍/👎, comment) to:
            *   Knowledge Base Explorer results.
            *   Individual agent responses in Multi-Agent Chat.
            *   MasterPlanner outcome summaries (linking `item_id` to `plan_log_kb_id`).

## Phase 14: Feedback Analysis & Reporting to Knowledge Base
*   **Objective:** Enable the system to analyze collected user feedback and store a summary report in the Knowledge Base.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **`feedback_analyzer.py` Script:**
        *   Created a standalone Python script (`$TOOLS_DIR/feedback_analyzer.py`).
        *   Reads `$LOG_DIR/feedback_log.jsonl`, aggregates statistics (sentiment, counts, etc.), and prints a JSON summary report.
        *   Handles empty or malformed log entries gracefully.
    *   **Orchestrator Integration (`generate_and_store_feedback_report`):**
        *   New async method in `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Executes `feedback_analyzer.py` as a subprocess, captures its JSON output.
        *   Constructs metadata and calls `store_knowledge` to save the report string to KB.
        *   Publishes a `"kb.feedback_report.added"` event.
    *   **UI Trigger:** Added a button in "System Information" UI to run `generate_and_store_feedback_report` and display confirmation/path to report.
    *   **Refactor (Concurrent):** Centralized path definitions and key configurations in `TerminusOrchestrator.__init__` and updated all methods to use these attributes.

## Phase 15: Integrated System Testing (Conceptual) & Advanced KB Content Analysis
*   **Objective:** Perform conceptual integrated testing of major system components (MasterPlanner, KB, Message Bus, Feedback System) to ensure interoperability. Enhance the Knowledge Base by enabling topic modeling for ingested content.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Conceptual Integrated Testing:**
        *   Defined and conceptually executed several complex user scenarios involving multiple system components.
        *   Verified data flow, error handling propagation, and expected outcomes for these scenarios.
        *   Identified potential areas for future refinement, such as MasterPlanner explicitly querying feedback reports from KB. (No code changes made during this testing phase, issues documented for future work).
    *   **ContentAnalysisAgent Enhancement (Topic Modeling):**
        *   Updated the prompt for `ContentAnalysisAgent` (used by `_handle_new_kb_content_for_analysis`) to request both keywords and 1-3 primary topics, expecting a JSON response.
        *   Modified `_handle_new_kb_content_for_analysis` to parse the JSON response and extract both `extracted_keywords` and `extracted_topics`.
        *   Ensured `_update_kb_item_metadata` can store the `extracted_topics` (along with general analysis metadata like agent, model, timestamp) if provided by the handler. (Verified existing method was sufficient).
    *   **MasterPlanner Prompt Update (Topic Utilization - Conceptual):**
        *   Documented the necessary changes to the `execute_master_plan` method to include `extracted_topics` (from KB items) in the context provided to the MasterPlanner LLM.
        *   Documented updates to the MasterPlanner LLM's main system prompt to instruct it to consider these topics for better planning. (These changes were documented for manual application due to tool limitations with direct file modification of the complex installer script).

## Phase 16: Enhanced Planner Intelligence (Feedback & Topics) and System Robustness
*   **Objective:** Improve MasterPlanner's decision-making by enabling it to learn from past feedback and utilize richer context (topics). Concurrently, enhance system robustness through better error handling and script interactions.
*   **Key Features & Changes (Conceptual & Documented for Manual Application due to Tool Limitations):**
    *   **MasterPlanner Feedback Utilization (Conceptual Design):**
        *   Designed logic within `execute_master_plan` for MasterPlanner to query the KB for `feedback_analysis_report` documents.
        *   Designed parsing of these reports to extract actionable insights.
        *   Outlined modifications to the MasterPlanner's main prompt to include these feedback insights, guiding it to adapt planning strategies.
    *   **MasterPlanner Topic Utilization (Conceptual Design & Prompt Update Documentation):**
        *   Re-documented (from Phase 15) the necessary changes to `execute_master_plan` for formatting KB item context to include `extracted_topics`.
        *   Re-documented updates to the MasterPlanner LLM's main system prompt to instruct it to consider `extracted_topics`.
    *   **System Robustness - Error Logging (Conceptual Design):**
        *   Defined more granular `try-except` blocks and enhanced logging messages for `_handle_new_kb_content_for_analysis` and `generate_and_store_feedback_report` to improve debuggability.
    *   **System Robustness - Script Output Validation (Conceptual Design):**
        *   Designed structural validation checks (e.g., for expected keys) for the JSON output received from `feedback_analyzer.py` within `generate_and_store_feedback_report`.
    *   **Note on Application:** Initial attempts to apply these fine-grained Python code changes directly within the `updated_terminus_installer.sh` script's heredocs via automated tools proved unreliable. These changes were subsequently applied directly to the externalized Python source files in Phase 18 after the codebase refactoring.

## Phase 17: Critical Codebase Refactoring - Python Source Separation
*   **Objective:** Decouple core Python application code (`master_orchestrator.py`, `terminus_ui.py`) from the main bash installer script (`updated_terminus_installer.sh`) to improve maintainability and enable reliable automated code modifications.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Python File Externalization:**
        *   The complete Python code for `master_orchestrator.py` (including all previously developed features and conceptual enhancements for topic/feedback utilization by MasterPlanner, improved logging, and validation logic) was extracted and saved to a new dedicated file: `src/agents/master_orchestrator.py`.
        *   The complete Python code for `terminus_ui.py` was extracted and saved to a new dedicated file: `src/terminus_ui.py`.
    *   **Installer Script Modification:**
        *   The `updated_terminus_installer.sh` script was modified (during `fix/installer-source-alignment`) to replace heredoc embeddings of `master_orchestrator.py` and `terminus_ui.py` with bash commands that copy these files from `src/` to their respective locations in `$INSTALL_DIR`.
        *   The installer's handling of `agents.json` was subsequently updated (during `fix/unify-agents-config`) to also copy `src/agents.json` instead of using a heredoc.
    *   **Benefit:** This refactoring allows Python code changes to be made directly to the `.py` source files and `agents.json` to be the single source of truth, improving maintainability and standardizing the development workflow.

## Phase 18: Application of Deferred Enhancements to Externalized Python Code
*   **Objective:** Implement previously documented conceptual enhancements directly into the newly separated Python source files (`src/agents/master_orchestrator.py`).
*   **Key Features & Changes Applied:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Topic Utilization:**
        *   Modified `execute_master_plan` in `src/agents/master_orchestrator.py` to correctly format Knowledge Base context (general documents and plan logs) to include `extracted_topics`.
        *   Updated the MasterPlanner LLM's main system prompt within `execute_master_plan` to explicitly instruct it to consider `extracted_topics` alongside keywords for improved planning.
    *   **MasterPlanner Feedback Utilization:**
        *   Added logic to `execute_master_plan` in `src/agents/master_orchestrator.py` for MasterPlanner to query the KB for `feedback_analysis_report` documents.
        *   Implemented parsing of these reports to extract actionable insights.
        *   Modified the MasterPlanner's main prompt to include these feedback insights, guiding it to adapt planning strategies.
    *   **System Robustness - Error Logging & Validation:**
        *   Implemented more granular `try-except` blocks and enhanced logging messages in `_handle_new_kb_content_for_analysis` and `generate_and_store_feedback_report` methods in `src/agents/master_orchestrator.py`.
        *   Added structural validation checks for the JSON output received from `feedback_analyzer.py` within `generate_and_store_feedback_report`.
    *   **Outcome:** All conceptually designed enhancements from Phases 15 & 16 related to MasterPlanner intelligence and system robustness are now implemented in the primary Python codebase.

## Ongoing Challenges & Notes
*   **Dependency Version Lookup:** (Resolved) The concern about placeholder dependencies in `README.md` has been addressed; all dependencies in `*_requirements.txt` are now pinned. The `passlib` specific issue was also resolved to `passlib==1.7.4`.
*   **Subtask Reporting Inconsistencies:** (Historical Note) Throughout development, there were several instances where subtask execution reports did not align with the requested task, requiring manual verification or re-runs. This complicated progress tracking. (This note remains for historical context of the overall project development if it refers to agent's interaction with a human, not specific to this session's automated tasks).

This log serves as a high-level summary of the development journey and the current state of the project.
