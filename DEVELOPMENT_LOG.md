# Terminalis AGI - Development Log & Process Summary (Z Report)

This document summarizes the major phases, key features implemented, and significant decisions made during the development and enhancement of the Terminalis AGI ecosystem.

## Phase 0: Initial Codebase Analysis & Weakness Identification
*   **Objective:** Understand the initial `script_content.txt` and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Key Findings:** Monolithic bash script, lack of version pinning for Python dependencies, basic error handling, hardcoded configurations, opportunities for new features.

## Phase 1: Initial Improvements & Professional Automation Foundations
*   **Objective:** Refactor the core script, standardize dependencies, improve robustness, and externalize configurations.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   Refactored `script_content.txt` into logical Bash functions.
    *   Python dependencies shifted to `*_requirements.txt` files with (initial) version pinning.
    *   Enhanced error handling in the installer (`set -e`, improved messages, exit on critical failures).
    *   Addressed security concern in `auto_dev.py`'s `run_command` method (using `shlex.split`).
    *   Externalized AI agent configurations into `agents.json`.
    *   Improved `launch_terminus.py` with better process monitoring (restart limits).
    *   Added initial user experience improvements to installer (disk space check, Ollama pre-check).
    *   Created initial `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE`.

## Phase 1.5: Finalize Phase 1 Professional Automation (Interim Plan)
*   **Objective:** Complete remaining UI and orchestration logic from initial goals.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   Added Streamlit Dashboard project template to `auto_dev.py`.
    *   Updated UI (`terminus_ui.py`) for new project scaffolding options.
    *   Implemented foundational "Intelligent Task Orchestration" in `master_orchestrator.py` (basic keyword routing).

## Phase 2: Basic Video Agent & Code Mod Backend/UI (Scope adjusted by subtask reporting)
*   **Objective:** Introduce multimedia capabilities (video) and initial AI code modification.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Basic Video Processing Agent (`VideoCrafter` features in Orchestrator):**
        *   Added `ffmpeg` system dependency.
        *   `moviepy` dependency confirmed.
        *   Backend methods in `TerminusOrchestrator` for video info, frame extraction, GIF conversion.
        *   Streamlit UI for video processing.
    *   **AI-Assisted Code Modification (Experimental):**
        *   Backend method `modify_code_in_project` added to `TerminusOrchestrator` (with prompt refinements).
        *   UI for this feature added to "Code Generation" mode.

## Phase 3: Expanding Creative & Cognitive Capabilities
*   **Objective:** Enhance CodeMaster, add audio capabilities, and improve orchestrator context awareness.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Advanced CodeMaster:**
        *   Refined prompts for `modify_code_in_project`.
        *   Added `explain_code_snippet` and `generate_code_module` methods to orchestrator.
        *   Integrated these into the Streamlit UI.
    *   **AudioMaestro Agent:**
        *   Added `espeak`, `libespeak1` system dependencies.
        *   Added `pydub`, `pyttsx3` Python dependencies.
        *   Defined `AudioMaestro` in `agents.json`.
        *   Backend methods for audio info, format conversion, TTS in orchestrator.
        *   New "Audio Processing" UI section.
    *   **Enhanced Orchestrator Intent (Contextual Awareness):**
        *   `parallel_execution` in orchestrator now uses UI `operation_mode` as a primary hint for agent selection.

## Phase 4: Advanced Orchestration & Specialized AI Integration
*   **Objective:** Introduce a planning agent and more advanced intent understanding.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **MasterPlanner Agent:**
        *   Defined `MasterPlanner` agent in `agents.json` (using a powerful LLM).
        *   Implemented `execute_master_plan` in orchestrator: prompts `MasterPlanner` for a JSON plan, parses it, and executes steps sequentially with basic dependency substitution.
        *   UI toggle in "Multi-Agent Chat" to enable `MasterPlanner`.
        *   UI logic to display multi-step plan results.
    *   **Advanced Intent Classifier:**
        *   Integrated zero-shot classification (`transformers` pipeline with `facebook/bart-large-mnli`) into `TerminusOrchestrator`.
        *   Classified intent is passed as context to `MasterPlanner`.

## Phase 5: Dependency Finalization & Enhanced Planner/Context
*   **Objective:** Resolve most pending dependencies and further improve MasterPlanner's context.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **Aggressive Dependency Resolution:** Successfully updated versions for most remaining placeholder dependencies (tensorflow-quantum, cirq, distributed, pyarrow, etc.). `passlib` remains unresolved.
    *   **Enhanced MasterPlanner (Dynamic Agent Awareness):** `MasterPlanner` prompt now uses a dynamically generated list of available agent capabilities.
    *   **Contextual Memory:** Implemented conversation history in `TerminusOrchestrator`; history is passed to `MasterPlanner` and assistant turns are summarized by an LLM for the history.
    *   **UI for Conversation History:** Added UI expander to show recent conversation history.

## Phase 6: SystemAdmin Enhancements & Verification (Current work before this log)
*   **Objective:** Add more system diagnostic tools and verify previous complex implementations.
*   **Key Features & Changes:**
    *   **SystemAdmin Backend:** Added `get_os_info`, `get_cpu_info`, `get_network_config` to orchestrator, with platform-aware commands. Updated `execute_agent` routing for `SystemAdmin`. (Verified via manual file read after subtask).
    *   **SystemAdmin UI:** Added UI elements in "System Information" to trigger and display results from new diagnostic capabilities. (Verified via subtask report).
    *   **MasterPlanner Iterative Refinement Verification:** Confirmed backend logic for one-cycle plan revision is present. (Verified via subtask report).

## Ongoing Challenges & Notes
*   **Dependency Version Lookup:** Persistent tool limitations (JavaScript errors on PyPI, `robots.txt` blocks) have made programmatic resolution of some package versions (`passlib`) very difficult. These require manual updates.
*   **Subtask Reporting Inconsistencies:** Throughout development, there were several instances where subtask execution reports did not align with the requested task, requiring manual verification or re-runs. This complicated progress tracking.

This log serves as a high-level summary of the development journey and the current state of the project.
